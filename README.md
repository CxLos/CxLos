Hello and welcome to my GitHub! My name is Carlos Bautista. I have a B.S in Business Administration with a concentration in International Business from Montclair State University. I am originally from New Jersey and moved to Austin in 2021. It was here in this city that I really became exposed to the tech world and found out that data science was the career path for me. I started my journey by enrolling in the Coding Bootcamp Certificate Program with UT Austin where I learned about the fundamentals of web development. I learned how to code on the front end as well as the backend where I primarily utilized JavaScript, React, SQL, HTML, and CSS. After Successful completion of this program, I decided to further my skills even more by enrolling the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate Program. Here I learned about the principles and fundamentals of Data Science where I focused primarily on coding with SQL, Python, and its libraries (numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.). Please feel free to take a look at my projects!
