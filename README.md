### Carlos Bautista

Hello, my name is Carlos Bautista. I have a B.S in Business Administration with a concentration in International Business from Montclair State University. I am from New Jersey, and I moved to Austin in 2021. It was here that I was really exposed to the tech world and made a lot of connections in the field and realized this is where I wanted to grow my career. After enrolling and graduating from Coding Bootcamp Certificate Program with UT Austin, I decided to home in and sharpen my coding skills a little more and realized that Data Science was the discipline for me. I have proficiency in Python programming language, SQL, Pandas, Numpy, and Excel. I work very well in situations where I need to be self-motivated, but also work very well on collaborative teams of people with diverse backgrounds and experiences. I have a strong Analytical mindset and work very well with breaking down numbers, as well as being very adaptive to the everchanging and quickly evolving Tech environment.
